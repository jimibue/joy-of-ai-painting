## What is React?

React.js or simply React is a free, open-source JavaScript library created by Facebook and is used for building user interfaces. Let's see what the React docs say about it.

### 1. React is declarative
React makes it painless to create interactive UIs. Design simple views for each state in your application, and React will efficiently update and render just the right components when your data changes.

Declarative views make your code more predictable and easier to debug.

### 2. React is component-based

Build encapsulated components that manage their own state, then compose them to make complex UIs.

Since component logic is written in JavaScript instead of templates, you can easily pass rich data through your app and keep state out of the DOM.


### 3. Learn React once, write React anywhere

React doesn't make assumptions about the rest of your technology stack, so you can develop new features in React without rewriting existing code.

React can also render on the server using Node and power mobile apps using React Native.

## Why learn React?

   ### 1. High in-demand skill
      If you are looking for a job in Web Development, you can't go wrong learning React.  If you know React, React Native makes it easy to take those React skills and start making native mobile apps.
   ### 2. Build complex apps 
     Do you want to create complex and interactive UI's? Do you want to maintain your sanity in the process? React is a good choice here.
   ### 3. Large community
     React is one of the most popular JS libraries out there and that means there will be plenty of resources and support when you are building with it.  It is also maintained and used by Facebook so you can have some security in knowing it will be maintained and updated to keep it relevant. 

## Other options

   React is not the only tool to build user interfaces.  There are many other options but the two popular ones are Angular and Vue. They are all good options but React is the most widely used and established so we will use it.
